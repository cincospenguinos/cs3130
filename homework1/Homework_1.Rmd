# Problem 1

If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets, then $A-B = A$, as there is no interesection between $A$ and $B$.
Thus $P(A-B) = P(A)$, as $P(A-B) = P(A \cap B^c) = P(A)$ for disjoint events.

# Problem 2

  a. Someone is not rich: $R^c$
  b. Someone is rich and not famous: $R \cap F^c$
  c. Someone is rich or famous: $R \cup F$
  d. Someone who is not rich or famous: $(R \cup F)^c$

# Problem 3

Given that $P(R) = 0.15$, $P(F) = 0.08$, and $P(R \cap F) = 0.06$, the solution to (a) is quite straightforward:

$$\begin{align}
P(R^c) &= 1 - P(R) &\text{Compliment Rule}\\
&= 1 - 0.15 \\
&= 0.85
\end{align}
$$

The solution to (b) is a bit more intense:

$$\begin{align}
P(R \cap F^c) &= P(R - F) &\text{Definition of set difference}\\
&= P(R) - P(R \cap F) &\text{Difference Rule}\\
&= 0.15 - 0.06 \\
&= 0.09
\end{align}
$$

The solution to (c):

$$\begin{align}
P(R \cup F) &= P(R) + P(F) - P(R \cap F) &\text{Inclusion-Exclusion Rule}\\
&= 0.15 + 0.08 - 0.06 \\
&= 0.17
\end{align}
$$

The solution to (d):

$$\begin{align}
P((R \cup F)^c) &= 1 - P(R \cup F) &\text{Compliment rule}\\
&= 1 - (P(R) + P(F) - P(R \cap F)) &\text{Inclusion-Exclusion Rule}\\
&= 1 - (0.15 + 0.08 - 0.06) \\
&= 1 - 0.17 \\
&= 0.83
\end{align}
$$

# Problems 4 & 5

Let $\Omega = \{HHH, THH, HTH, HHT, T TH, THT, HTT, TTT\}$, which represents all the possibilities of three tosses of a coin. Now let $A \subseteq \Omega$, where $A$ corresponds to some set following a rule written out in English, as provided below:

$$\begin{align}
\text{Tails is thrown exactly twice} & A = \{TTH, THT, HTT\} \\
\text{Tails is thrown at least two times} & A = \{TTT, TTH, THT, HTT\} \\
\text{Tails did not appear before heads appeared} & A = \{THH, THT, TTH, TTT\} \\
\text{The first throw resulted in tails} & A = \{HHH, HTH, HHT, HTT\} \\
\end{align}
$$

Since $|\Omega| = 9$, then $P(A) = \dfrac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$. Below are the probabilities corresponding to each of the given rules:

1. $P(A) = \dfrac{3}{9} = \dfrac{1}{3}$, or `r 3 / 9`
2. $P(A) = \dfrac{4}{9}$, or `r 4 / 9`
3. $P(A) = \dfrac{4}{9}$, or `r 4 / 9`
4. $P(A) = \dfrac{4}{9}$, or `r 4 / 9`
