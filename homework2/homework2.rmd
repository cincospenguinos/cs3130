# Problem 1

Let $W$ be the event of a white ball being drawn, and $R$ be the event of a red ball being drawn.
In this problem we are asked to calculate $P(R_{2} \cap R_{1})$, given that whenever a red ball is drawn
the ball is returned to the urn. Thus the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw, or $P(R_1)$,
is $P(R_1) = \frac{1}{2}$, while $P(R_2) = \frac{3}{4}$, etc. Given this information, this calculation is 
relatively straightforward:

$$
\begin{align}
P(R_2 \cap R_1) &= P(R_2 | R_1) * P(R_1) & \text{Multiplication rule}\\
&= \frac{3}{4} * \frac{1}{2}&  \\
&= \frac{3}{8} &\\
\end{align}
$$

# Problem 2

```{r}
# The urns 
first = c("R", "W") # "Given W1" is identical to first
givenR1 = c("R", "R", "R", "W")
omega = c("RR", "RW", "WR", "WW")

trials = 10000
twoRs = 0

for(i in 1:trials) {
  draw1 = sample(first, 1, TRUE)
  draw2 = sample(givenR1, 1, TRUE)
  
  if(("R" %in% union(draw1, draw2)) & !("W" %in% union(draw1, draw2))){
    twoRs = twoRs + 1
  }
  
  #cat(paste("(", draw1, ",  ", draw2, ")  "))
  #cat(paste(union(draw1, draw2)), "\n")
}

cat(paste("P(R2) = ", twoRs / trials, "\t Expected: ", 3 / 8))
